    "question_1": "What can I do with IRMA?",
    "answer_1_markdown": "With IRMA it's easy to log in and make yourself known. You disclose only the necessary attributes of yourself. For instance, in order to watch a certain movie, you disclose that you are over 16 years old and nothing else. With IRMA you can digitally sign documents too. You only use relevant characteristics of yourself, in some sort of digital stamp. In this way IRMA allows you to sign as medical doctor, as citizen, or in some other role.\n\nMore and more websites support logging in with IRMA. For instance, doctors in The Netherlands can access medical dossiers via the website [helder](https://www.helder.health/). IRMA support is growing especially at municipalities and health care providers. To get an idea of the possibilities, you can try out yourself some of the available IRMA [demo's](https://privacybydesign.foundation/demo-en/).",
    "question_2": "What to do if I lose my mobile?",
    "answer_2_markdown": "If you lose your mobile, nobody can use your IRMA app, at least if you have chosen a non-trivial PIN.\n\nYou can protect yourself even more: upon installing IRMA you have been given the choice to enter an email address. If you have done so, you can block your IRMA app altogether via [MyIRMA](https://privacybydesign.foundation/myirma/). The IRMA app on your old (lost) mobile is then completely unusable.\n\nIf you have not yet added an email address in [MyIRMA](https://privacybydesign.foundation/myirma/) you can still do so now. This is recommended.\n\nOn your new mobile you can re-install the IRMA app and re-fill it with your data. Then you are good to go again.",
    "question_3": "What makes IRMA privacy-friendly and secure?",
    "answer_3": "Your personal data are protected via your personal PIN. Your data are stored exclusively in the IRMA app and not in the cloud.\n\nThe data in your IRMA app are digitally signed by the source (issuer) where the data come from (such as the local authorities).\n\nIn this way a website or shop, where you make yourself known, can cryptographically verify that your data are genuine.\nThis exchange of personal data happens directly between your mobile and the website. No one else can see that you make yourself known there, not even the organisation behind IRMA.",
    "question_4": "Where are my IRMA data stored?",
    "answer_4": "Your data are stored in the IRMA app on your mobile and not in the cloud.\n\nYou explicitly agree (or not) to reveal your personal data from your IRMA app to a website.\nWhen you remove your data from the IRMA app, they are really gone from IRMA.",
    "question_5": "Why do the data in the IRMA app have limited validity?",
    "answer_5": "Every card in IRMA shows its validity. The validity period depends on the kind of data on the card and how stable these data are. Your name and date of birth data are valid for five years, but your address data only one year. The source (issuer) of the data determines this validity period. The cards in your IRMA app may thus expire. The IRMA app then gives you a warning.\n\nYou can always, also without such a warning, refresh your cards by reloading them from the source. For instance, after your 18th birthday you can reload your data from your municipality so that you can prove that you are older than 18 now.",
    "question_6": "Can I install IRMA on multiple mobile devices?",
    "answer_6": "Yes, on every mobile device (Android or iOS) you can install a separate IRMA app and fill it with cards with your personal data. It is actually wise to do so. If you lose one device, you can still log on with your other device.",
