    "answer_1_markdown": "Yivi is a secure, privacy-friendly, and free mobile application. Yivi functions as a digital wallet that is filled with personal data. You can use it to log in to online services or to prove your identity. But always while sharing the minimum amount of personal data. Because Yivi empowers you to make that choice. What you store, what you share, and with whom. You're in control, always.\n\nYou don't have to remember account details and long passwords. Only your Yivi PIN code. And when sharing data you're only sharing the data that is needed, nothing more. Be it to order a package online or to make an appointment with your doctor.\n\nWant to order a ticket online? With Yivi, you can easily prove that you're older than 18. And not share more details. Protecting your privacy in the process. You can also digitally sign documents with Yivi, using your personal attributes as a signature. You can sign as a civilian, a doctor, or with another role. Check the current overview to see the list of organizations that are already using Yivi.",
    "question_2": "Why does Yivi exist?",
    "answer_2": "Giving people back control over their online data is the mission of Yivi. What are you storing? What do you share? And with whom? Yivi empowers you to make that choice. With our app, you can decide what others learn about you. This data is shared from your phone with the requesting party, nobody else is part of that transaction. Not even Yivi.\n\nEverything is stored securely on your phone, encrypted, and behind a PIN-code. There is no centralized data or cloud storage that contains your personal data. Lost your phone? Don't panic. Just remotely block your Yivi app. That prevents anyone from using your data without your knowledge.\n\nSelling your data isn't, and will never be, our revenue model. And still, Yivi is free to use. Is there a catch? No there isn't! Only the organizations using Yivi pay for the services, ensuring Yivi remains free for you.\n",

    "answer_3_markdown": "The Privacy by Design Foundation is the non-profit organization behind Yivi. You might not be familiar with that name, but you’ve likely benefited from their vision if you care about privacy-first digital identity. The foundation is dedicated to developing secure, privacy-preserving technologies that put users in control of their data. They created Yivi to give everyone a way to identify themselves digitally—safely and selectively. \n\n Caesar Groep, with decades of experience in IT innovation and infrastructure, makes sure Yivi works smoothly and securely. From the backend to the user interface, Caesar Groep ensures that every interaction with Yivi is seamless and trustworthy—anytime, anywhere.",

    "answer_6_markdown": "If you lose your phone nobody can access your Yivi app as it's secured with your PIN code. Want to increase security? Add a recovery e-mail address during installation. This will allow you to remotely block the application. Ensuring nothing will happen when you lose your phone.\n\nHaven't added a recovery address yet? Just go to MijnYivi to add it. ",
    "question_7": "Can I install Yivi on multiple mobile devices?",
    "answer_7": "Yes, we even recommend doing so! Just download the app on multiple devices and load it with your personal data. If you lost one device you always have a backup.",

    "answer_10": "The supplier of the data can determine what the validity period of the data is. So your data can expire. You will get a warning in the Yivi app if this happens. How long your data remains valid depends on the type of data. Your name and birthdate are valid for 5 years. Your address is just one year. You can always refresh your data, whenever you want. For instance by refreshing your age after your 18th birthday. That way you can directly show that you're older than 18. ",
