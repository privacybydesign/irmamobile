IRMA keeps your personal data safe and gives you control.

The IRMA app manages your personal IRMA cards: you can receive new cards, selectively disclose them to others, and associate them with digital signatures. Examples of tickets are "I am over 18", "my name is ..." and "I have access to ...". These are safely stored on your phone and are protected by your PIN code.

IRMA is produced and maintained by the <a href="https://privacybydesign.foundation/irma-en">Privacy by Design Foundation</a> together with <a href="https://sidn.nl/en">SIDN</a>. It is freely available and open source. Find out more at <a href="https://irma.app">irma.app</a>.
